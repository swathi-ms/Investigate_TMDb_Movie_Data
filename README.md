# Investigate_TMDb_Movie_Data
Udacity Project2 - Investigate TMDb movie data 

I did this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. Investigated The Movie Database (TMDb), consisting of  10866 lists of movies dated between 1960 through 2015. The questions that I plan on exploring this dataset are

What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
How does vote count affect revenue?
Which genre has the most number of movies?
Which genres generate the highest revenue?

Data - tmdb-movies.csv(cleaned from original data on Kaggle)

Peruse the file to see the results.
