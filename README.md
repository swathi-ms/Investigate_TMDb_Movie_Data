# _Udacity Project 2 - Investigate TMDb movie data_

### Project Overview
I did this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. Investigated The Movie Database (TMDb), consisting of  **_10866_** lists of movies dated between 1960 through 2015. In this project,  I looked at the dataset, figured the below questions that I planned on exploring. Cleaned the dataset and analyzed it using many python libraries Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib. Created a report to share my observations.

### Installation
Installed **Anaconda** which had all the necessary libraries

* `Numpy`
* `pandas`
* `csv`
* `Matplotlib`

### Data 
**tmdb-movies.csv** 

### The questions that I planned on exploring this dataset are

* What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
* How does vote count affect revenue?
* Which genre has the most number of movies?
* Which genres generate the highest revenue?

**_(Look into the investigate-a-dataset.ipynb to view the results of the analysis)_**

### What did I learn? 

* Understood the entire cycle of data analysis.
* Asking relevant questions that can be answered through the analysis.
* Gather and clean data in a project specific format.
* Analyze and report the findings.
